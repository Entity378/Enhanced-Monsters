![Source downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/veld-dev/LootableMonsters/total) ![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/veld-dev/LootableMonsters)   
Lethal Company mod allowing to pick enemies as loots, and some enemies to loot some stuff.

### Features
- Allows you to sell dead mobs.
- Configurable mobs minimum and maximum value.
- Masked mimics drop their mask when they die.
- All "dangerous" mobs display their rank (dangerousness) when you scan them.

I must still think about more features in fact.
